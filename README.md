# Uno
Rules: 
This is a version of Uno in which the player plays against a specified number of bots that he/she chooses at the beginning of a game. 

The game starts with one card in the discard pile. You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action. For instance, if the Discard Pile has a red card that is an 8 you have to place either a red card or a card with an 8 on it. You can also play a Wild card (which can alter current color in play).

If the player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match, they must draw a card from the Draw pile. If that card can be played, play it. Otherwise, the game moves on to the next person in turn. You can also play a Wild card, or a Wild Draw Four card on your turn.

If the player does not earn first place, his/her placement in the game will be decided by the amount of penalty points his/her cards earn in relation to the other bots. A numerical card will cost its own number of penalty points. A draw two, skip, or reverse will cost 20 penalty points each. A wild card will cost 50 penalty points each.
